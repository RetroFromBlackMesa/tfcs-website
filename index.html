<title>Team Fortress Classic: Source</title>
<h3>What is TFC:Source?</h3>
<p>This is an attempt to remake and port Team Fortress Classic over to Source without the use of leaked code. The hope is for it to resemble what could have been if Valve had made it along side CS:Source and Half-Life 2. Currently we hope it looks like TFC in the source engine (obviously), but with higher poly models and higher quality textures and maybe a few improvements.</p>
